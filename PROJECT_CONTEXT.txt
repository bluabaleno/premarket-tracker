POLYMARKET/LIMITLESS PRE-TGE TRACKER - PROJECT CONTEXT
================================================================================

ROLE
----
You work at Limitless Exchange, launching and managing Pre-TGE prediction markets.
Your markets compete with Polymarket's pre-market offerings.


GOAL
----
Prove that Pre-TGE markets generate sustained "long-tail" trading volume AFTER
a token launches - not just during the hype cycle.

The thesis: Pre-TGE markets capture attention before launch, and that attention
converts into ongoing volume via post-TGE daily price prediction markets.


MARKET STRUCTURE
----------------
For each project, you typically launch:

1. PRE-TGE MARKETS (before token launch):
   - "Will X launch a token by [date]?"
   - "X FDV above $Y one day after launch?"

2. POST-TGE MARKETS (after token launch):
   - Daily price predictions: "$TOKEN above $X.XX on [date]?"
   - These run for ~5 days after TGE to capture the long-tail volume


KEY METRICS
-----------
- Pre-TGE Volume: Total volume traded before the token launches
- Post-TGE Volume: Cumulative volume from daily price markets after launch
- Volume Ratio: Post-TGE / Pre-TGE (target: >100% means long-tail thesis works)
- Days Since TGE: How long the post-launch markets have been running


WHAT THE DASHBOARD TRACKS
-------------------------
1. Daily Changes Tab: Price movements across all active pre-TGE markets
2. Launch Timeline Tab: When projects are expected to TGE based on market odds
3. Gap Analysis Tab: Compare Polymarket vs Limitless coverage and odds spreads
4. Arb Calculator Tab: Find cross-platform arbitrage opportunities
5. Portfolio Tab: Track your personal positions and P&L
6. Launched Tab: Track post-TGE volume performance (the key metric!)


DATA LIMITATIONS
----------------
- Polymarket: Can fetch closed/resolved market data via API (slug required)
- Limitless: NO closed market endpoint - must capture data BEFORE resolution
  - However, if you have the market slug, you CAN fetch individual closed markets
  - You have access to internal database for historical slugs


CURRENT STATE (as of Jan 2026)
------------------------------
- 22 launched projects tracked
- Cysic is the first with full post-TGE daily market data (5 days, $171K volume)
- Most other projects have pre-TGE volume only (no post-TGE markets tracked yet)


CURRENT PRIORITY
----------------
Get Limitless to PARITY with Polymarket's pre-TGE offerings, prioritizing:
1. Projects with Kaito leaderboards (yaps.kaito.ai)
2. Projects with Cookie3 leaderboards

Use the Gap Analysis tab to identify what Polymarket has that Limitless doesn't.


NEXT STEPS
----------
- Record post-TGE daily market volumes for more projects
- Build out historical data to demonstrate the long-tail effect
- Use cumulative charts to visualize volume growth after TGE
- Compare performance across projects to identify what drives sustained volume


FILES
-----
- daily_tracker.py: Main script that fetches data and generates dashboard
- dashboard.html: The interactive dashboard output
- launched_projects.json: Stores launched project data and volume history
- src/polymarket/: Modular codebase (api/, data/, analysis/, ui/, utils/)


USAGE
-----
Run daily: python daily_tracker.py

Add a launched project:
    from src.polymarket.data import LaunchedProjectStore
    store = LaunchedProjectStore()
    store.add_project(name="X", ticker="X", tge_date="YYYY-MM-DD", ...)

Record daily post-TGE volume:
    store.record_volume("project-id", "YYYY-MM-DD", limitless_volume=X, polymarket_volume=Y)
